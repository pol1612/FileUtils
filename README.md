# FileUtils
This project is about a library that has a method that checks, given a path,
 if the file of the path exists, if the file is a file (not a directory), 
if the path is empty and if the absolute path doesn’t contain white spaces. 
If it's a file that exists and the absolute path doesn’t contain white spaces,
it returns a true boolean.
